    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Windows in PyFlink are used to split a stream of data into finite chunks, allowing for efficient processing of stream-based data. Stream processing is inherently unbounded, meaning that the data never stops flowing. Windows provide a way to group data into manageable subsets (based on time or count) so that operations like aggregation, counting, or summing can be performed on finite groups of data. This is essential for tasks like calculating running averages, aggregating counts over time intervals, and more.<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">There are several types of windows in Flink:<span>\n",

    "    - <span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Event Time: The time when the event was generated, which is typically used when the data source includes timestamps.<span>\n",
    "    - <span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Processing Time: The time when the event is processed by the system.<span>\n",
    "    - <span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Ingestion Time: The time when the event is ingested into the system.<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Count Windows:These windows group events based on the number of elements. Once the window reaches a predefined number of elements, it triggers the operation and emits the result.<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Session Windows: These windows group events that are close in time to each other. A session window is defined by an idle gap of time. If there is a gap longer than the session timeout, the current window will be closed, and a new session window will be created.<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Global Windows: A special type of window that represents the entire stream as a single window. Typically used with custom window functions.<span>\n",

    "<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Types of Windows in PyFlink<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Tumbling Windows: Fixed-size, non-overlapping windows. Every event belongs to exactly one window, and the windows do not overlap. For example, a 10-second tumbling window will group all events that arrive in the 10-second time slot, and once the window is closed, the next one starts.<span>\n",
